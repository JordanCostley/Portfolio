We examined the rise of food truck popularity and other information on the landscape such as food truck events and current operations.</p>
                                <p>To get a better understanding of current offerings we examined other applications to gauge what they already offered and what they were lacking. We evaluated information based on our surveys to see which pertinent and vital features were already in place and which were missing. We focused primarily on apps that attempted to offer a solution most similar to ours but also took into consideration other food review apps. </p>

                            <h5>Initial Survey</h5>
                            <p>To begin our journey we asked ourselves a few questions: Who is our target demographic? What information would someone want out of this app? How many in-depth features do we want to include? We used these questions and initial domain research to narrow down potential interviewees and questions to ask. After interviewing our perceived target audience we narrowed down features and information potential users would be seeking out when using an app such as ours that would help them achieve their goals. Although there would be a variety of personas that would make use of a food truck app, we focused on our primary persona while including options for edge cases.
                            </p>
                            <p>We wanted to offer a complete package that would offer incentives both to customers and food truck operators. We wanted to narrow down our own preconceptions and features that we wanted to fit the goals of potential users. We did include edge case features with the mindset of potential edge case events while keeping a primary focus on the key path or main scenarios. Given the rise in popularity there are a large number of personas that might fit as our primary user. As such interviewing a number of people was beneficial in establishing differences between my assumptions and what users actually want and how they think regarding food.</p>

                                <p>We built personas based on young professionals living in urban cities. We imagine our primary users working and living in a city that offers plenty of night life and events. Our primary user would be a type of person who seeks out new experiences and culinary diversity. The primary user enjoys quick access to a variety of options within walking distance of their work. We would also target secondary users who might be uncertain about the world of food trucks by building a trustworthy environment to discover new dining experiences. Food trucks bring an inherent charm, but that does not mean certain expectations in regard to food have to be dismissed.</p>

We also decided to include secondary uses to gauge initial user feedback during testing.

                            <p>We developed a wireflow for how we intended the user to navigate through our screens. We converted this wireflow into a lo-fidelity prototype which we printed out and conducted user testing with. We wanted to ensure that the app operated in an efficient and predictable manner according to the user's needs. I was primarily tasked with creating the layout and interaction flows of the prototype while my team member focused on visual elements. We thought a printed, lo-fidelity prototype would produce stronger results than our hand drawn wireframes. Although I offered my insight and opinion of visual elements, my team member brought her experience to quickly knock out visual elements.</p>
                            <p>We conducted a handful of user tests utilizing our scenarios to test out all screens of our prototype. My team member took the role of moderator administering the test while I made observations and placed the various pieces of paper as the user moved throughout the scenarios.</p>

                            <p>The lo-fidelity prototype proved to be extremely beneficial in examining user habits and thought patterns when viewing our current design schema. Although I had considered the general flow of how a user might interact with our design, I did not consider fully the various ways they would according to previous interaction with other apps. This allowed me to tweak the layout to account better for alternative paths and greater ease of use. Other minor details were noted to make certain buttons and states clearer such as the calendar, home, and profile buttons. The food truck profile largely remained the same with the inclusion of better signifiers. The greatest amount of information came from the scenario of ordering an item from the food truck. Certain verbiage and button placement confused one of the users tested and needed to be addressed.</p>

                            <p id="addPadding">Other considerations for better chunking of content was gained from testing. The main use of simply finding nearby food trucks proved to be fairly straightforward for the home screen, there were minor visual and layout tweaks to benefit the users according to our tests. As far as the food truck profile, a food truck inherently has a large amount of information that they wish to convey to their guests. This information also includes a hierarchy of what a user looking for a quick bite to eat. The goal of the food truck profile is designed to give a brief overview of the restaurant including reviews and category before listing the menu. Secondary uses such as ordering from the food truck is available behind touch inputs to give quick access for those who need it but not distract those not making use of this feature. </p>

We focused first on the largest areas in need of adjustment before moving onto the smaller, minor issues. We made note of any interactions that a user attempted to make that did not fit our intended direction and flow of design and adjusted accordingly. </p>
                                    <p>These changes were implemented before conducting a final hi-fidelity test. We were able to fine tune the prototype even further from this testing as there were few logistical issues and the primary concerns were predominantly visual.</p>

                            <p>We explored the concept of offering events as an alternative means of giving both food truck vendors and users an incentive to use our app beyond the primary goal. Ultimately we wanted more options to allow users to explore and discover food trucks in there area beyond the map system. This area proved to be a challenge on the side of logistics rather than the simple function of a calendar system. Consideration and planning for these things would need to be considered before fully rolling out this feature of the app. </p>

I find myself with a growing interest in the world of food trucks given their rise in popularity. Being able to see our initial challenges and pretenses change throughout the course of developing our prototype was very interesting. Taking various theories and concepts and putting them into effect really helps demonstrate their purpose. It's one thing to conceptually design with humans in mind and another to go through the process of designing and iterating to make a better product.</p>

Although we did not get to fully flesh out this app I would love to revisit the concept one day to explore other possibilities. The great thing about design is there is always room to improve and learn.</p>

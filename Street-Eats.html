                            <p>To begin our journey we asked ourselves a few questions: Who is our target demographic? What information would someone want out of this app? How many in-depth features do we want to include? After interviewing our perceived target audience we narrowed down features and information potential users would be seeking out when using an app such as ours.
                            </p>
                            <p>We wanted to offer a complete package that would offer incentives both to customers and food truck operators. We wanted to narrow down our own preconceptions and features that we wanted to fit those which potential users were seeking out.</p>

                            <p>We initially listed a number of features we might make use of a food truck app. We then narrowed down the options based on difficulty, level of importance, and feedback from initial interviews. We also decided to include secondary uses to gauge inital user feedback during testing.</p>

We evaluated information based on our surveys to see which pertinent and vital features were already in place and which were missing. We focused primarily on apps that attempted to offer a solution most similar to ours but also took into consideration other food review apps. </p>

We would also target secondary users who might be uncertain about the world of food trucks by building a trustworthy environment to discover new dining experiences. Food trucks bring an inherent charm but that does not mean certain expectations in regard to food have to be dismissed. </p>

This area proved to be a challenge on the side of logistics rather than the simple function of a calendar system. Consideration and planning for these things would need to be considered before fully rolling out this feature of the app. </p>

                            <p>All in all this process was very enlightening and enjoyable to explore. I find myself with a growing interest in the world of food trucks given their rise in popularity. Being able to see our initial goals and pretenses change throughout the course of developing our prototype was very interesting. Taking various theories and concepts and putting them into effect really helps demonstrate their purpose. It's one thing to conceptually design with humans in mind and another to go through the process of designing and iterating to make a better product.</p>

                            <p>Ultimately being able to explore new technologies is always enjoyable for me so it was a pleasure to explore the inVision App seeing all that it has to offer. Although we did not get to fully flesh out this app I would love to revisit the concept one day to explore other possibilities. The great thing about design is there is always room to improve and learn.</p>

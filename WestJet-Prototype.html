                            <h5>Overview</h5>
                            <p>WestJet is a Canadian airline competing to provide services to an ever-growing crowd of travelers. With the amount of airline passengers continuing to increase year after year along with the widespread adoption of mobile devices it is paramount that companies provide a seamless mobile experience to allow users to achieve their goals.</p>

                            <h5>Objective</h5>
                             <p>To put into practice various principles and design laws I have learned, I redesigned the WestJet mobile website and built a prototype using Axure to test my design. It was of high priority that I minimized chances of errors while creating a more digestible layout of content by chunking sections of information to accommodate the various users.</p>

                            <h5>Observatiosn & Tasks</h5>
                            <p>To best explore the Axure prototyping tool, I observed the existing mobile site acting as a user looking to purchase a ticket after gathering any pertinent information the airline was offering. Not being informed on WestJet as a company I wanted to see what set them apart from other airlines. Although I appreciated the hierarchy of allowing users to access ticket purchases immediately upon entering the site, I wanted to see more information about the airline in general rather than simply cards showcasing destinations serviced.</p>
                            <p>Another observation I made was on the lack of convention and potential errors found within the book a flight tabs and menu system. Although I was on a mobile device many of the inputs seemed too small for accurate touch inputs. This when paired with the sheer amount of information being shown to the user made it fairly hard to difficult certain sections. Lastly the inclusion of two menu bars was fairly confusing as it cluttered up the screen with even more information to be digested.</p>
                            <p>Based on observations and pain points from my interactions with the site I decided to focus on three primary tasks: These tasks included: <span class="boldText"> booking a flight</span> (Full process of entering information leading to selection screen), <span class="boldText"> managing your flight(s)</span> (checking your reservation via logging in with account or reservation code), and <span class="boldText">checking into your flight.</span>I wanted to ensure that I attempted to remedy what I believed to be potential issues while offering scenarios that could fully test my implementation.</p>

                                <h5>Concept</h5>
                                <p>To encourage the user to explore the site the inclusion of a well balanced structure with ample whitespace was needed to minimize distractions and increase efficiency. Redistribution of content was a must as to not overwhelm the user by an overload of content. Design patterns would be used to remove confusion caused by non-standard solutions as well as a means of simplifying content. Seeing as it is a mobile site I had a focus on control and ease of use.</p>
                                <p>Consistent design features were used to create a system wide standard of actions. Ultimately the completion of a task is a high-level goal and as such I wanted the schema of the user to match the design of the site. I approached this from a universal standards standpoint as well as a more localized standardization of features and design. </p>
                                <p><span class="boldText">Primary focuses</span> to be explored included better <span class="boldText">chunking of menu systems</span>, <span class="boldText">improved non-instrumental value</span> via aesthetics and visual design, <span class="boldText">improved button placement and spacing</span> to reduce errors.</p>

                                <h5>Planning</h5>
                                <p>An information architecture was built based on the schema used in various airline websites. My primary focus was on adjusting the placement of content and overall visuals to create a more efficient interaction. I wanted to simplify sections and give them space to breathe and be interacted with by touch rather than precise mouse inputs. I also wanted to better chunk the information present for completing actions to allow the user to better interact with the menu systems.</p>

                                <p>Additionally, I wanted to include informative content both in the header as well as below the fold. I found there to be little informative content on the mobile site and the existing content was not very inviting. As a new user to the WestJet brand I wanted to know what set them apart beyond simply destinations. I wanted to ensure the content hidden on their website could be easily accessed and digested. The foundations were in place but needed some adjusting to allow them to fully work.</p>

                            <p>An initial design was created focusing on the main tasks to define the specific screens and key path to be used. Seeing as the main focus was on menu systems there were only a few screens with primary design focusing on input and interaction. I wanted to keep the bones of the website and style while tweaking it to demonstrate how small decisions can benefit the user.</p>

                            <p>An initial round of testing was conducted on the prototype and proved to be beneficial primarily in the form of visual feedback. Other information provided revolved around logistical concerns and pain points within the functionality of the mockup. Two major points were regarding the drop down menu system including visual icons that were not needed as well as a lack of suggested cities when using the input field.</p>

                            <p>To assess the visual redesign of the site I used the Visual Aesthetics of Websites Inventory survey to assess the state of the design.

User feedback was also recorded regarding their interaction with the site during the completion of three scenarios: booking a flight, managing your flight(s), and checking into your flight.</p>

There are multiple input fields and buttons needed for the flight booking section and functionality while reducing errors was key. I increased button sizes to accommodate touch input while also rearranging placement of buttons and input fields as to not have any inputs immediately next to one another.<br><br> I wanted to follow a schema that any user could understand and relate to via use of universal signifiers and general layout. The goal was to allow users to make sense of the information quicker and reduce sensory overloaded.</p>

                                <p>Accidental input can be a large cause of frustration. Although mouse and pointer input can be very precise, touch input cannot. This called for consideration of input field size as well as button size. This allows for both less frustration as well as fewer errors for a more efficient process. I wanted to be sure that any user would be able to interact with the website without needing extreme precision or technical knowledge.</p>

                                <p>Simplification was very important in this redesign. I used signifiers and schema that an average user would be accustomed to and one that a new user could easily learn. Although this seemed like a minor adjustment, the menu system is a tool that a user can rely on for assistance or simply a means of efficient navigation.</p>

                            <p>I really enjoyed this process as it was my first time attempting a redesign of an existing product. Instead of simply thinking of concepts and applying theories and laws to a fresh design I had to apply a different means of thinking. Applying knowledge learned within the constraints of an already existing product was a good means of comparing two different design choices.</p>
                            <p>This was also my first time using Axure which proved to be both challenging and rewarding. The initial learning curve was more intense than other software I have experienced, but it seems to offer a lot of flexibility. I have only ever done basic prototypes with limited functionality, but I can see creating a more robust product as being a real test and would offer a lot more insight.</p>
                            <p>There are things that I would definitely like to work on and refine with this design, but ultimately it proved a very good learning experience. It was interesting to see how my perceptions as a user differed from other users while attempting to accommodate a variety of users.</p>

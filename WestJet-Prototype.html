                            <p>WestJet is a Canadian airline brand and is one of the many airlines attempting to provide services to an ever-growing crowd of travelers. With the amount of airline passengers continuing to increase year after year along with the growth of mobile devices it is paramount that companies provide a seamless mobile experience.</p>

                             <p>To put into practice various principles and design laws I redesigned and created a prototype of the WestJet mobile website. I had a focus on control and ease of use. Given the wide variety of users that WestJet will encounter it was of high priority that I minimized chances of errors while creating a modern and inviting product via the use of design patterns and stronger use of whitespace.</p>

                            <p>Based on observations and pain points from my interactions with the site I decided to focus on three main tasks. These tasks included: <span class="boldText"> booking a flight</span>, <span class="boldText"> managing your flight(s)</span> (checking your reservation via logging in with account or reservation code), and <span class="boldText">checking into your flight.</span></p>

                            <p>I chose these tasks as they are primary uses of an airline website and would incorporate designs that could be applied to various secondary uses of the site later down the line. These tasks would also prove to be insightful during testing to compare my initial thoughts on my perceived pain points.</p>

                                <h5>Concept</h5>
                                <p>As stated earlier the primary focus of my redesign involved a focus on control and ease of use. A focus on balance and whitespace was used to help invite the user to explore the site and remove distractions. Redistribution of content was a must as to not overwhelm the user by an overload of content. Design patterns would be used to remove confusion caused by non-standard solutions as well as a means of simplifying content.</p>
                                <p>To remove complications when a user is going through the stages of action, consistent design features would be used to create a system wide standard of actions. Ultimately the completion of a task is a high-level goal and as such I wanted the schema of the user to match the design of the site both from a universal standards standpoint as well as a more localized standardization of features and design.</p>
                                <p>Primary focuses to be explored included better groupings of menu systems, improved non-instrumental value via aesthetics and visual design, improved button placement and spacing to reduce errors.</p>

                                <p>An information architecture was built out based on the schema used in various airline websites including WestJet. My primary focus was on adjusting the placement of content and overall visuals to create a more efficient interaction. I wanted to simplify sections and give them space to breathe and be interacted with my touch rather than precise mouse inputs.</p>

                                <p>Additionally, I wanted to include informative content both in the header as well as below the fold. I found there to be little informative content on the mobile site and that which was there was not very inviting. The foundations were in place but needed some adjusting to allow them to fully work.</p>

                            <p>An initial round of testing was conducted on the prototype and proved to be beneficial primarily in the form of visual feedback. Other information provided revolved around logistical concerns and pain points within the functionality of the mockup.  I wanted to not only verify that my visual changes were effective but also gain general usability feedback in terms of the flow of the design being natural and expected.</p>

                        <div class="summaryP2" id="addPadding2">
                            <p>To assess the visual redesign of the site I used the Visual Aesthetics of Websites Inventory survey to assess the state of the design. This method focuses on four categories: Simplicity, Diversity, Colorfulness and Craftsmanship using a total of 18 questions that you rate how much you agree or disagree with the statements. User feedback was also recorded after users completed the given scenarios based on the previously listed tasks, booking a flight, managing your flight(s), and checking into your flight.</p>

                                <p>My focus was primarily on providing more whitespace to allow the provided content enough room to breathe. There are multiple input fields and buttons needed for the flight booking section and functionality while reducing errors was key. I removed increased button sizes to accommodate touch input while also rearranging placement of inputs as to not have any inputs immediately next to one another.<br><br> I wanted to follow a schema that any user could understand and relate to via use of universal signifiers and general layout to allow them to make sense of the information quicker and not have their senses overloaded.</p>

                                <p>Accidental input can be a large cause of frustration. Although mouse and pointer input can be very precise, touch input cannot. This called for great consideration of input field size as well as button size. This allows for both less frustration as well as fewer errors for a more efficient process. I wanted to be sure that any user would be able to interact with the website without needing extreme precision or technical knowledge.</p>

                                <p>Simplification was very important in this redesign. I wanted to use signifiers and schema that an average user would be accustomed to and one that a new user could easily learn. Although this seemed like a minor adjustment, the menu system is a tool that a user can rely on for assistance when they find themselves in confusion or simply a means of quick navigation equating a more efficient experience.</p>

                            <h5>Takeaway</h5>
                            <p>I really enjoyed this process as it was my first time attempting a redesign of an existing product. Instead of simply thinking of concepts and applying theories and laws to a fresh design I had to apply a different means of thinking. Applying knowledge learned within the constraints of an already designed product was a good means of comparing two different design choices and then putting your choice up to test.</p>
                            <p>This was also my first time using Axure which proved to be both challenging and rewarding. This tool took much longer to learn than other I have used but it seems to offer a lot of flexibility. I have only ever done basic prototypes with limited functionality, but I can see creating a more robust product as being a real test and would offer a lot more insight.</p>
                            <p>There are things that I would definitely like to work on and refine with this design but ultimately it proved a very good learning experience. </p>

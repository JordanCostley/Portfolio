                            <p>Spotter is an iOS mobile application aimed at assisting users to search for, discover, and track digital content to watch on various streaming services. Spotter focuses on three main challenges: helping users discover content to watch, simplifying cross-platform content browsing, and improving clarity of content entering and leaving platforms. Spotter was created alongside two other team members as a class project utilizing Goal-Directed Design.</p>

                            <h5>The Project</h5>
                            <p>For my Interaction Design class, I led a team of three to create the Spotter digital streaming assistant app. The team consisted of Cole Christiansen, Anthony Jones, and me. Having grown up in the information age, our team is familiar with the variety of streaming services offered and their pitfalls. We aimed to transform the way users interact with their preferred content platforms and to minimize frustrations that we are all too familiar with. I was tasked with directing our team as we utilized the Goal-Directed Design process to design our app. This process allows for a solid foundation in research to get a better understanding of our potential users before establishing concrete solutions to design and test.</p>
                            <p>Goal-Directed Design starts with a research phase to establish an understanding of the potential domain, competitive technologies, and user goals & behaviors. This research allows designers to model a persona as a means of synthesizing their data to assist with creating a solution that matches user expectations, behaviors, and goals. Having a better understanding of what the user looks like means establishing requirements that are more targeted at users while aligning with business goals and requirements. These requirements define what the app aims to accomplish and help the user complete. The requirements are turned into the design via wireframing of what the actual app will look and behave like before being tested with a variety of usability testing methods.</p>

                                <p>The research stage within Goal-Directed Design is a process used to establish the groundwork for creating our application as it details expectations, information on the domain, current technologies, and ultimately user goals. The research stage involves a kickoff meeting to discuss plans and timelines, a literature review to survey the domain, a competitive audit to explore existing technologies, and user interviews to discover user goals and behaviors. The purpose is to ensure that the final product reflects the user goals while bridging the gap of business needs and goals.</p>

                            <p>The first stage of the research phase is a kickoff meeting. A kickoff meeting is held to define project goals and schedule further stages in the design process. Because this is a project for class, we have no real clients. As such, we sat down and discussed our assumptions to determine the content a kickoff meeting would cover and focus on. We accomplished this by answering a variety of questions that a business might be looking to establish when starting a project.</p>

                                <p>A literature review was completed to gather information on the potential domain. We wanted to gather empirical data to give a deeper perspective of the domain we are venturing into. Our focus landed on looking into the current landscape of television and the landscape of streaming. We targeted this information to give ourselves a broader look into the subject before narrowing down. My main focus for this section was assisting with finding sources that my teammates could use to find useful data. This area was Anthony’s primary focus during the research phase as he led the charge of gathering information from the sources. To further fill any gaps in the research, I researched information in areas that were not initially covered during our first round of research.</p>
                                <p>The main findings of this research centered around the transition of traditional television dominating the world of entertainment to digital streaming platforms garnering a larger audience year after year. There has been a large switch from television being an at home, family activity to a general means of entertainment that can be accessed anywhere. With this there has been a large decline in households subscribing to traditional satellite or cable providers. Cutting the cable has become the norm as many households are opting to use a growing number of online alternatives. This increase in streaming platforms brings more options for those switching, which has muddied the landscape with the content being spread out across various services.</p>

                            <p>To gain a stronger understanding of the domain of online streaming content we conducted a competitive audit to explore existing solutions to see what their solutions to user goals are as well as gain insight into user responses to these implementations. This strategy also gives further insight into potential technologies that can be leveraged to develop a practical solution. We explored both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store in conjunction with a web-only service to gain a range of insight on the potential domain. This area was my main focus and job during this phase of the research along with my team member, Cole. Although this information proved extremely insightful as to what information to look for in user interviews and what was currently possible with technology, it did not establish what specifically our app would look like as we wanted to be certain that our solution focused on our user goals.</p>

Regarding the reviews we made note of reviews that included information longer than a simple positive or negative remark. We wanted data that was more insightful than a few words and a star rating. We looked for patterns such as repeating features that were mentioned in positive and negative manners. These features were used as points of reference when conducting our user interviews and areas of focus if the technologies were included in our final design according to our user goals.</p>

                                <p>To properly understand who our users are and what their goals are, we conducted user interviews to explore who our potential users are, in what context the application fits into their lives, their goals and motivations, their mental models, and problems and frustrations within the domain of online streaming. To achieve this knowledge, we first created a persona hypothesis to think about what our user might look like in terms of what type of people might use our application, how their needs and behaviors might vary, and what behaviors and environments that might need to be explored.</p>
                                <p>To ensure we had an insightful interview we had one moderator who focused on having a conversation while two facilitators made notes and asked the participant to clarify points or speak more deeply about comments that came up in the discussion. I took the position as a facilitator for these interviews while Anthony was the moderator and Cole was the other facilitator. It was my role to ensure that any important details that were mentioned by the participant were noted and explored. I would ask them to expand on any topics they mentioned that might help us better understand who they are and what their goals are. I would also have them clarify any points of interest that were not clear from their answers. The ultimate goal was to discover who they were as a person so we could be informed in our decisions later in the design process.</p>

                                <p>We interviewed five participants in total to allow us to get a sizeable pool of data which was used to map into personas. We mapped and synthesized the interview data to create an application according to their goals in the context of their life. We did this by individually synthesizing our thoughts after each interview and coming together to discuss findings by establishing patterns of behaviors. These patterns were used to map the participants into groupings. The first grouping became those who used streaming platforms frequently and the second grouping were those who used streaming platforms on a less frequent basis.</p>

                            <p>A persona is used to represent the synthesized data of users interviewed. These participants are mapped together where patterns exist. As a means of easily digesting this information, personas are created to take the major components of the various participants where patterns emerged and synthesize the data into one whole model. We established two personas, the first is our primary user who watches content on a streaming platform on a regularly. The second persona is the supplemental user as their needs are represented under the primary user needs and they are satisfied by the solution devised for the primary user.</p>

By focusing the research on patterns we were able to remove any outlier data and focus on solutions that satisfy the whole group.</p>

                                            <p>Jake is a full time student and also works part-time as a busboy. His main focus is making the most of his time while in college. He is fairly social but often finds himself at home streaming a movie on his TV at night.</p>
                                            <p>He greatly enjoys discussing what he has watched with his friends and discovering new shows or movies to watch next. He often finds himself scrolling through the recommended content to find what to watch if he doesn’t have something in mind.</p>
                                            <p>Jake utilizes a variety of streaming platforms but his favorite is Netflix due to the amount of content hosted there. He often finds himself flipping between platforms when deciding what to watch. He also gets recommendations from his friends on what to watch.</p>

She spends free time socializing with her sorority sisters and friends. Sometimes she finds herself catching up on a show or movie that her friends told her about, but not very often.</p>
                                                <p>Diana rarely finds herself sitting down to stream digital content as she often gets distracted from what she is watching. She will however from time to time watch a show recommended by her friends or members of her sorority.</p>
                                                <p>Diana gained access to Netflix via a shared account and does not have access to multiple streaming platforms to view content.

                            <p>Once we understood what our users looked like and determined what their goals and behaviors were, we began to discuss the requirements of the app. We did this by constructing context scenarios in which our users would use our product such as the environment, amount of time available, and potential distractions. This helped us put ourselves into their shoes for the day and consider all the various ways the app might be used. By considering these contexts we discussed and came up with several requirements. These requirements are not specific features or layouts within the product but rather what the app will do at a higher level. We established roughly twenty total requirements for the app.</p>

                            <h5>The Framework</h5>
                            <p>Once we established the research on the domain and technologies, understood our users and their goals, and determined the requirements, we were able to begin discussing the wireframe and design. This is a stage that benefits from meeting in person and creating designs quickly with many revisions. Unfortunately, due to the events of COVID-19 we had to reconsider how we would continue the project. After looking at various digital offerings and alternatives to a physical whiteboard I landed on InVision Freehand as it offered real-time collaboration and would allow me to use my iPad and Apple Pencil to quickly sketch.</p>
                            <p>I took the lead and discussed designs with my team as I drew up wireframe designs in inVision Studio. We did this to determine what the main user flow would be as well as secondary flows. We established the key path scenario, the most used interaction, to be the process of searching for a specific movie to determine what platform it is available on. We wanted this to be the focus as it is what our interview participants spoke about as being the largest struggle when looking for content. After designing the screens for this flow, we asked ourselves what other features would be needed in conjunction with the key path scenario. Being able to collaboratively discuss the design allowed for various viewpoints and more insightful decisions versus having only one designer.</p>
                            <img src="images/spotter_wireframe.png" class="decorativeImageDesktop" alt="Image of wireframe drawings"/>
                            <p>After we established our overall screen designs and user flows, we each sat down and drew out more detailed screens. I wanted to verify that we had considered all details of our design and possibilities. I also wanted to ensure that we were all on the same page with our final solution and used this as an opportunity for us to explore variations that had been discussed earlier in the initial meeting. Being able to sit down and more thoroughly explore ideas allowed me to better prepare myself to move into a digital design and create screens more efficiently. This also allowed us to better discuss plans further with questions that came up when further examining our idea before moving into a higher fidelity design.</p>

                                <h5>Prototyping</h5>
                                <p>Traditionally I would start with a paper prototype to verify the general layout of our design and user flows but due to the circumstances we moved straight into Figma to design and prototype. We started by creating the visual screens and elements before moving into the interaction of the app.</p>
                                <p>We worked largely collaboratively on this section. An initial meeting was used to establish the design language of the app to allow each member to work autonomously as they were free. I delegated certain sections of the app to the other two members to focus on establishing the initial designs. I worked on sections of my own as well before meeting again to discuss progress and make a plan to move into a more high-fidelity design. I wanted to ensure that as we moved forward, we all agreed and that decisions were grounded around our user goals. It was my primary goal to ensure that all designs were coherent and matched our design language.</p>

                            <p>Once we established our overall visual design, we started to convert the screens into a working prototype with interactions. This was my primary role as I was most familiar with Figma and could most efficiently get the app up and running. My focus was on handling the small details of linking the elements so that we could proceed with testing. We went over the interactions and tested the app internally before moving onto usability testing with users outside our team. I wanted to ensure that any minor technical issues were ironed out before allowing outside users to interact with the app to minimize distractions.</p>

                            <p id="addPadding">We conducted usability tests virtually. Although in-person tests would have been more ideal, we had to make the most of the situation. We utilized Google Hangouts as it allowed the user to screen share their device as they interacted with the prototype. We had one moderator and one facilitator during the tests. I took the role of moderator and used a set of questions and scenarios targeted at having the user interact with every primary screen of the prototype. The facilitator was in charge of taking notes and looking for areas that needed to be further explored or to have answers more thoroughly explained.</p>

                                <p>The tests proved beneficial in verifying the user flows we defined. The primary interactions and navigation acted as expected for the users. Primary areas of concern revolved around homepage content and clarity, search filtering options, lack of search bar on the explore page, and ability to mark content as watched. Other areas of concern were minor design errors such as incorrect color and interactions behaving differently than expected.</p>
                                <p>The largest area that needed adjusting was the homepage. Although users liked the concept of a homepage tailored to their tastes, it was not apparent that the content on the homepage was targeted at their tastes. Users also felt that the homepage was fairly empty when compared to the explore page. We have addressed these issues by adding features offered on the explore page to the home page. We also tweaked the verbiage and titles used on the homepage to make it into the For You page.</p>
                                <p>Other areas of concern were easily addressed by adding content that users expected in sections. We added a search bar to the explore page to make it easier to search for content. We expanded the genres offered on the explore page to give more options to the user when searching for genres beyond their taste. Additionally, we added genre filtering to the search navigation to give users more control when searching for specific content.</p>

These preferences are defined in the user settings in addition to pulling data from the watchlist. Limiting the content on this page allows for quick browsing without adding to the cognitive load of the user. If the user wishes to view content beyond their taste, the Explore page offers trending content and general genres.

We wanted to deliver content in a manner that maximizes the users’ options by giving the option to remove streaming platforms not owned by the user. A search function with filtering is also included to allow users to more quickly search for specific content and check which platform it is located on.</p>

                            <p>We wanted to ensure that there was clarity of content available on the various platforms. It is easy to find all the new content entering a platform but knowing when a movie or TV show is leaving can be difficult. To tackle this problem, we made clarity of where content is available a priority. We also utilized wanted the watchlist to function as a means of tracking content that users like to allow the system to push notifications when a movie or show is leaving. Minimizing the steps to reach content allows the focus to be on the experience of watching entertainment versus the search for it.</p>

                                <p>This project was quite an interesting challenge. Overall I felt confident throughout the process as I built on previous knowledge from previous projects. However, this being the first time having the proper title of leader was interesting. Thankfully my team was very supportive and rose to the challenge at every step. Being able to work efficiently in the first half of the process certainly proved beneficial when COVID-19 shook things up. Although it was not ideal moving to a fully digital environment, we were able to make the most of the situation and even explore new tools and techniques. Having to work in an environment other than the ideal allowed for a different perspective and insight on the process.</p>

                                <p id="addPadding">Although I am satisfied with our results, some areas could be more polished and explored. Not having access to ideal testing procedures certainly affected the results. There are areas of interaction that I would have liked to explore more thoroughly but I am confident that the overall flow and interaction in the final product is accurate to user goals and expectations. We did address the concept of clarity of content, but I would like to explore this concept further to offer a more complete solution for the users. I believe this area to be of fairly high importance based on our interviews and think a more prominent feature would benefit the product. I look forward to taking the skills learned from this process and further developing them in the future.</p>

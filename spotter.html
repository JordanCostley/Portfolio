                            <p>For my Interaction Design class I led a team of three to create the Spotter digital streaming assistant app. The team consisted of Cole Christiansen, Anthony Jones, and me. Having grown up in the information age, our team is familiar with the variety of streaming services offered and their shortcomings. We aim to transform the way users interact with their preferred content platforms and minimize frustrations that we are all too familiar with. I was tasked with directing our team as we utilized the Goal-Directed Design process to design our app.</p>

                            <p>Goal-Directed Design is a multi-stage user-centered methodology created by Alan Cooper. This multi-stage process allows for a solid foundation in research to get a better understanding of users before developing a solution to design and test.</p>

This helped us put ourselves in the user's shoes for the day and consider all the various ways the app might be used.

                            <p>Once we established the research on the domain and technologies we were able to begin discussing the wireframe and design. This is a stage that benefits from meeting in person and creating designs quickly with many revisions. Unfortunately, due to the events of COVID-19, we had to reconsider how we would continue the project. I landed on InVision Freehand as it offers real-time collaboration and would allow us to quickly sketch wireframe designs.</p>
                            <p>I took the lead and discussed designs with my team as I drew up wireframe designs. <span class="boldMe">The goal of this was to quickly explore a variety of layout options and flows.</span> The main conversations revolved around home content versus the explore page content and the placement of the search bar on the home screen. We wanted to make sure that we were delivering both a unique experience and an expected one.</p>
                            <p>I took the initial sketches and further developed them on my iPad.

                                <p>Once the general layout was established, we moved into converting it into a digital prototype. We started by defining the visual language of the app to create a design system to work from. Overall we wanted a design that was casual and geared towards dark environments.</p>
                                <p>Once we established the overall visual language I had the team work independently until it was time to discuss progress and the current design.

In total, we conducted three rounds of usability testing.</span> Despite this, we still used these tests to better refine our design as they offered great insight. Various minor interactions were missing or did not work as expected, including filtering the search results. Additionally, the personalized homepage was not immediately clear to the user.</p> 
                                <p>We refined the design by adding to the filtering system and fixing the minor interactions. We also reworked the onboarding and homepage name to make it more clear that the content is personalized to the user. Other technical and layout issues were also addressed.</p>

                                <p>Throughout the design process we focused on three challenges. These challenges are based on discoveries from our user interviews. We established these to be the three primary pillars of both what users wanted as well as a means of pushing our product above the others. Focusing on these pillars allowed us to tackle the challenges in an order from large to small to ensure we met all the expectations and requirements. The three main challenges: helping users <span class="boldText">discover content to watch, simplifying cross-platform content browsing,</span> and <span class="boldText">improving clarity of content</span> entering and leaving platforms. Below is a breakdown of the three primary challenges.</p>

                            <h5>Discover New Content</h5>
                            <p>The For You page allows quick access to content tailored to the user. We wanted to provide quick bite-size content that the user can explore based on their preferences. These preferences are defined in the user settings in addition to pulling data from the watchlist. Limiting the content on this page allows for quick browsing without adding to the cognitive load of the user. If the user wishes to view content beyond their taste, the Explore page offers trending content and genres beyond their favorites. We wanted this information to be separate to give clarity that the For You page is tailored to a specific user.</p>

                            <h5>Cross-Platform Browsing</h5>
                            <p>To allow users to easily view content across their chosen platforms, we added filtering by streaming platform to the For You and Explore pages. We wanted to deliver content in a manner that maximizes the user's options by giving them the choice to remove streaming platforms not owned by the user. Users can also search directly for a movie, show, or genre through the search feature. The search function also offers filtering to allow users to narrow down the results by genre, release date, platform, and age rating. Additionally, they can then sort the results to further narrow down their decision.</p>

                            <p>We wanted to ensure that there was clarity of content available on the various platforms. Icons are used to display where content can be found. Each description page includes a button that links directly to the streaming platform app. Additionally, it is easy to find all the new content entering a platform but knowing when a movie or TV show is leaving can be difficult. The watchlist functions as a means of tracking content that users want to watch to allow the system to push notifications when a movie or show is leaving the platform, as to allow the user to have time to watch the content before it leaves.</p>

                                <p>This project was quite an interesting challenge. Overall I felt confident throughout the process as I built on knowledge from previous projects. However, this being the first time having the proper title of leader was interesting. Thankfully my team was very supportive and rose to the challenge at every step. Being able to work efficiently in the first half of the process certainly proved beneficial when COVID-19 shook things up. Although it was not ideal moving to a fully digital environment, we were able to make the most of the situation and even explore new tools and techniques. Having to work in an environment other than the ideal allowed for a different perspective and insight on the process.</p>

Not having access to ideal testing procedures certainly affected the results. There are areas of interaction that I would have liked to explore more thoroughly, but I am confident that the overall flow and interaction in the final product is accurate to user goals and expectations. We did address the concept of clarity of content, but I would like to explore this concept further to offer a more complete solution for the users. I believe this area to be of fairly high importance based on our interviews and think a more prominent feature would benefit the product. I look forward to taking the skills learned from this process and further developing them in the future.</p>

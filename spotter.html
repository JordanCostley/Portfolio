Spotter was created alongside two other team members as a class project utilizing Goal-Directed Design. Spotter focuses on three main challenges derived from user interviews and research to keep the focus on user goals while addressing business needs.</p>

                            <p>For my Interaction Design class I led a team of three to create the Spotter digital streaming assistant app. The team consisted of Cole Christiansen, Anthony Jones, and me. Having grown up in the information age, our team is familiar with the variety of streaming services offered and their shortcomings. We aim to transform the way users interact with their preferred content platforms and minimize frustrations that we are all too familiar with. I was tasked with directing our team as we utilized the Goal-Directed Design process to design our app.</p>
                            <h6 id="addPadding2">Design Process</h6>
                            <p>Goal-Directed Design is a user-centered methodology created by Alan Cooper. This multi-stage process allows for a solid foundation in research to get a better understanding of users before developing a solution to design and test. The bulk of the process focuses on research to discover information about the user including their goals and behaviors. This foundation in research is used to deliver a product that focuses on user goals and expectations. The steps include research, modeling, requirements, framework, and refinement in that order.</p>

                                <h5>Research</h5>
                                <p>We conducted research to establish an understanding of the potential domain, competitive technologies, and user goals & behaviors. This research allows us to create a solution that matches our user expectations, behaviors, and goals. Having a better understanding of what the user looks like means establishing requirements for the app that are more targeted at users while aligning with business goals and requirements. </p>
                                <p>The research stage within Goal-Directed Design is a process used to establish the groundwork for creating our application as it details expectations, information on the domain, current technologies, and ultimately user goals. The research stage involves a kickoff meeting to discuss plans and timelines, a literature review to survey the domain, a competitive audit to explore existing technologies, and user interviews to discover user goals and behaviors. The purpose is to ensure that the final product reflects the user goals while bridging the gap with business needs and goals.</p>

                            <h5>Competitive Audit</h5>
                            <p>To gain a stronger understanding of competitor technology and user views on them, we completed a competitive audit. This step allowed us to get a better sense of what was currently being offered and how their users felt about the solution. We wanted to be certain that our solution would be both feasible and competitive in the space by offering features that either do not exist on the others or are better than the others. This also helped us get an understanding of what users felt about the solutions offered to help avoid any points of contention.</p>

                            <p id="addPadding"> We explored both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store in conjunction with a web-only service to gain a range of insight on the potential domain. This area was my main focus and job during this phase of the research along with my team member, Cole. Although this information proved extremely insightful as to what information to look for in user interviews and what was currently possible with technology, it did not establish what specifically our app would look like as we wanted to be certain that our solution focused on our user goals.</p>

                            <p>We found that the competing apps often offered standard features that would be expected such as basic browsing and searching. However, many of these features were limited in their capabilities. There was a severe lack in personalization of the apps. Rather they were generic in their delivery of content like many of the streaming platforms already are. There was also lack of filtering in the search function and browsing. If one wanted to narrow their search down or browse by genre they simply could not beyond the default categories for many of the options.</p>

                                <h5>User Interviews</h5>
                                <p>To properly understand who our users are and what their goals are, we conducted user interviews. We looked for information such as in what context the application fits into their lives, their goals, motivations, mental models,  and problems or frustrations within the domain of online streaming. To achieve this knowledge, we first created a persona hypothesis which is used to define the different types of users we might expect to have. These are used to think about what our users might look like in terms of what type of people might use our application, how their needs and behaviors may vary, and what behaviors and environments that might need to be explored.</p>
                                <p>We had one moderator who focused on having a conversation while two facilitators made notes and asked the participant to clarify points or speak more deeply about comments that came up in the discussion. It was my job to ensure that any important details that were mentioned by the participant were noted and explored. I would ask them to expand on or clarify any details they mentioned that might help us better understand who they are and what their goals are. The ultimate goal was to discover who they were as a person so that we could be informed in our decisions later in the design process.</p>

The groupings become personas and have classifications based on their needs or uses of the product. As a means of easily digesting this information, personas are created to take the major components of the various participants and map the similarities to find groupings among the users and represent them as a model. This model is displayed as a persona to help the designers, stakeholders, and others involved in the project understand the users while keeping a focus on their goals. </p>

We wanted to make sure that our decisions were solving the problems and goals experienced by our participants that we interviewed.</p>

This helped us put ourselves into their shoes for the day and consider all the various ways the app might be used. By considering these contexts we discussed and came up with several requirements. These requirements are not specific features or layouts within the product but rather what the app will do at a higher level.</p>

                            <p>Once we established the research on the domain and technologies, understood our users and their goals, and determined the requirements, we were able to begin discussing the wireframe and design. This is a stage that benefits from meeting in person and creating designs quickly with many revisions. Unfortunately, due to the events of COVID-19 we had to reconsider how we would continue the project. After looking at various digital offerings and alternatives to a physical whiteboard I landed on InVision Freehand as it offered real-time collaboration and would allow me to quickly sketch wireframe designs.</p>
                            <p>I took the lead and discussed designs with my team as I drew up wireframe designs. We established the key path scenario, the most used interaction, to be the process of searching for a specific movie to determine what platform it is available on. After designing the screens for this flow, we asked ourselves what other features would be needed in conjunction with the key path scenario. Being able to collaboratively discuss the design allowed for various viewpoints and more insightful decisions versus having only one designer.</p>

                                <p>Having established the bones of our design, we were able to move into a digital prototype. An initial meeting was used to establish the design language of the app before allowing each member to work autonomously on screens when they had time. We completed various screens before meeting periodically to discuss progress and the current status of the design. I wanted to ensure that as we moved forward, we all agreed and that decisions were grounded around our user goals. It was my primary goal to ensure that all designs were coherent and matched our design language. Completing the visual elements of the design allowed us to start converting the screens into a working prototype with interactions. We linked the various screens together to give function to the visuals to allow interaction with the prototype.</p>

                                <p>After completing the interactions between the screens, we created questions for a usability test. We created scenarios that would allow the user to fully explore each function of the app and assess the usability of the design. Due to COVID-19 we conducted these tests virtually and had the users share their screens. Although the testing conditions were not ideal, the tests proved beneficial in verifying the user flows and design decisions we made. We were able to be confident in our decisions and the overall design of our app based on these results but still had some tweaks to make for the final prototype.</p>

We took the feedback and updated the prototype to land on the final design. We adjusted the home screen to be renamed "For You" and tweaked the search functionality to better meet user expectations. Below are a few of the final screens from the prototype.</p>

                                <p>Throughout the design process we focused on three challenges. These challenges are based on discoveries from our user interviews. We established these to be the three primary pillars of both what users wanted as well as a means of pushing our product above the others. Focusing on these pillars allowed us to tackle the challenges in an order from large to small to ensure we met all the expectations and requirements. The three main challenges: helping users <span class="boldText">discover content to watch, simplifying cross-platform content browsing,</span> and <span class="boldText">improving clarity of content</span> entering and leaving platforms. Below is a breakdown of the three primary challenges.</p>

                            <h5>Discover New Content</h5>
                            <p>The For You page allows quick access to content tailored to the user. We wanted to provide quick bite-size content that the user can explore based on their preferences. These preferences are defined in the user settings in addition to pulling data from the watchlist. Limiting the content on this page allows for quick browsing without adding to the cognitive load of the user. If the user wishes to view content beyond their taste, the Explore page offers trending content and genres beyond their favorites. We wanted this information to be separate to give clarity that the For You page is tailored to a specific user.</p>

                            <h5>Cross-Platform Browsing</h5>
                            <p>To allow users to easily view content across their chosen platforms, we added filtering by streaming platform to the For You and Explore pages. We wanted to deliver content in a manner that maximizes the user's options by giving them the choice to remove streaming platforms not owned by the user. Users can also search directly for a movie, show, or genre through the search feature. The search function also offers filtering to allow users to narrow down the results by genre, release date, platform, and age rating. Additionally, they can then sort the results to further narrow down their decision.</p>

                            <p>We wanted to ensure that there was clarity of content available on the various platforms. Icons are used to display where content can be found. Each description page includes a button that links directly to the streaming platform app. Additionally, it is easy to find all the new content entering a platform but knowing when a movie or TV show is leaving can be difficult. The watchlist functions as a means of tracking content that users want to watch to allow the system to push notifications when a movie or show is leaving the platform, as to allow the user to have time to watch the content before it leaves.</p>

                                <p>This project was quite an interesting challenge. Overall I felt confident throughout the process as I built on knowledge from previous projects. However, this being the first time having the proper title of leader was interesting. Thankfully my team was very supportive and rose to the challenge at every step. Being able to work efficiently in the first half of the process certainly proved beneficial when COVID-19 shook things up. Although it was not ideal moving to a fully digital environment, we were able to make the most of the situation and even explore new tools and techniques. Having to work in an environment other than the ideal allowed for a different perspective and insight on the process.</p>

                                <p id="addPadding">Although I am satisfied with our results, some areas could be more polished and explored. Not having access to ideal testing procedures certainly affected the results. There are areas of interaction that I would have liked to explore more thoroughly, but I am confident that the overall flow and interaction in the final product is accurate to user goals and expectations. We did address the concept of clarity of content, but I would like to explore this concept further to offer a more complete solution for the users. I believe this area to be of fairly high importance based on our interviews and think a more prominent feature would benefit the product. I look forward to taking the skills learned from this process and further developing them in the future.</p>

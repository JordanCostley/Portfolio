                            <p>For my Interaction Design class I led a team of three to create the Spotter digital streaming assistant app. The team consisted of Cole Christiansen, Anthony Jones, and me.  I was tasked with directing our team as we utilized the Goal-Directed Design process to design our app.</p>
                            <p>Having grown up in the information age, our team is familiar with the variety of streaming services offered and their shortcomings. <span class="highlightMe">I hypothesized that with the growing number of digital streaming platforms, users might have trouble finding content across various platforms.</span> We aim to simplify and transform the way users interact with their preferred content platforms and minimize the frustrations of currently available solutions.</p>

                            <p>Goal-Directed Design is a multi-stage user-centered methodology created by Alan Cooper. This multi-stage process begins with research to get a better understanding of user goals and expectations before developing a solution to design and test.</p>
                            <p>The first half of the process focuses on research to discover information about the user including their goals and behaviors. There are three types of goals:</p>

                            <p>To gain a stronger understanding of competitor technology and user views on them, we completed a competitive audit. This step allowed us to get a better sense of what was currently being offered and how users felt about the solution. To achieve this we examined apps available on the Google Play Store, Apple App Store, and a web-only service.</p>
                            <p>After browsing four apps and one website, I noted features that were available within the app and what features were placed on the home screen. I also made note of which apps allowed customization based on the user's available platforms and preference in genres. Lastly, I used the search function to explore the ease of use and filtering options available.</p>
                            <h6 id="addPadding2">Certain competitors stood out, but even they lacked key features.</h6>
                            <p>We found that competing apps often offered standard features that would be expected, such as basic browsing and searching. However, many of these features were limited in their capabilities. The apps lack filtering in the search function and browsing. The search function only allows users to browse by titles. <span class="highlightMe">There was also a severe lack of personalization within the apps as the recommendations were generic to all users.</span></p>

                                <p>To properly understand who our users are and what their goals are, <span class="highlightMe">we conducted five user interviews of students around the age of 20.

                                <p>We had one moderator leading the conversation while two facilitators made notes.

                                <p>It was my job to ensure that any important details mentioned by the participant were noted and explored. I would ask them to expand on or clarify any details they mentioned that might help us better understand who they are and what their goals are. The ultimate goal was to discover who they were as a person so that we could be informed in our decisions later in the design process.</p>
                                <p><span class="highlightMe">The main pain points for our primary users revolved around browsing their various platforms to find new content to watch.</span> When looking for something to watch they would scroll through one platform's catalog before the next, assuming they found nothing.

                            <p>Once we established the research on the domain and technologies we were able to begin discussing the wireframe and design. This is a stage that benefits from meeting in person and creating designs quickly with many revisions. Unfortunately, due to the events of COVID-19, we had to reconsider how we would continue the project. I landed on InVision Freehand as it offers real-time collaboration and would allow us to quickly sketch wireframe designs.</p>
                            <p>I took the lead and discussed designs with my team as I drew up wireframe designs. The goal of this was to quickly explore a variety of layout options and flows. The main conversations revolved around home content versus the explore page content and the placement of the search bar on the home screen. We wanted to make sure that we were delivering both a unique experience and an expected one.</p>
                            <p>I took the initial sketches and further developed them on my iPad. Although we covered most details in the initial brainstorming session, some minor elements needed further thought. <span class="highlightMe">I wanted to create design solutions that prioritized customization and ease of use when discovering/searching for content while not overwhelming the user with unnecessary information.</span> Our primary user, Jake, wants to make the most of his time and gets frustrated when he is stuck scrolling through his various platforms to find something to watch.

Being able to mirror the design onto a mobile phone allowed me to view the design in the context of how the user would see it. The overall focus was on balancing the content to keep it from overwhelming the user. Having a general layout allowed us to play with options such as button and icon design in addition to their placement.</p>
                                    <p>Due to COVID-19 we were unable to conduct a low-fidelity paper prototype. However, we conducted a cognitive walkthrough to consider the intended flows, interactions, and overall layout of the screens. There were minor changes made here such as the content displayed on the home screen and icon placement on the movie information screens. We waited until we had a higher fidelity prototype to test the design with users.</p>

                                <p>We started by defining the visual language of the app to create a design system to work from. Overall we wanted a design that was casual and geared towards dark environments.</p>
                                <p>I had the other team members work on the visual elements while I worked on creating the high-fidelity prototype including the layout and interactions. It was during this stage that tweaks were made to the design to simplify elements and rearrange content to make it more easily digestible.</p>
                                <h6 id="addPadding2">Usability Testing to refine the design.</h6>                    
                                <p><span class="highlightMe">Due to COVID-19, we were only able to conduct our testing in a virtual setting. In total, we conducted three rounds of usability testing with fellow students.</span> Despite this, we still used these tests to better refine our design as they offered great insight. Various minor interactions were missing or did not work as expected, including filtering the search results. Additionally, the personalized homepage was not immediately clear to the user.</p> 
                                <p>We refined the design by adding to the filtering system and fixing the minor interactions. We also reworked the onboarding and homepage name to make it more clear that the content is personalized to the user. Other technical and layout issues were also addressed.</p>

                                <li class="olItem">Some search filtering options were missing such as genre and selecting platforms was confusing to some users.</li>
                                <li class="olItem">The lack of ability to mark content as watched after placing a movie or show in the watchlist screen.</li>

                                <p>Throughout the design process we focused on three main challenges. These challenges are based on discoveries from our user interviews. We established these to be the three primary pillars of both what users wanted as well as a means of pushing our product above the others. Focusing on these pillars allowed us to tackle the challenges in an order from large to small to ensure we met all the expectations and requirements. The three main challenges: helping users <span class="highlightMe">discover content to watch, simplifying cross-platform content browsing, and improving clarity of content entering and leaving platforms.</span> Below is a breakdown of the three primary challenges.</p>

                            <p>The For You page allows quick access to content tailored to the user. We wanted to provide quick bite-size content that the user can explore based on their preferences. These preferences are defined in the user settings in addition to pulling data from the content on the user's watchlist.</p>
                            <p>Limiting the content on the home screen allows for quick browsing of content that the user most likely will enjoy. If the user wishes to view content beyond their taste, the Explore page offers trending content and genres beyond their favorites. We wanted this information to be separate to simplify the process of finding something to watch by not overwhelming the user with choices.</p>

                            <h5>Cross-Platform Browsing</h5>
                            <p>To allow users to easily view content across their chosen platforms, we added filtering by streaming platform to the For You and Explore pages. We wanted to deliver content in a manner that maximizes the user's options by giving them the choice to remove streaming platforms that the user does not own.</p>
                            <p>Users can also search directly for a movie, show, or genre through the search function. The search function also offers filtering to allow users to narrow down the results by genre, release date, platform, and age rating. Additionally, they can then sort the results to further narrow down their decision. Overall, the primary focus was on quickly delivering content based on what the user wants to watch.</p>

                            <p>We wanted to ensure that there was clarity as to what content users have access to. Curated content is displayed based on the user's preferences and icons are displayed on the movie detail screens detailing what platform the movie or show is on.</p>
                            <p>For content saved to the watchlist there is an icon on the main screen alongside a stream movie button that links directly to the corresponding app. Additionally, the watchlist will send push notifications when a movie or show is leaving the platform to allow the user to be sure they make the most of their platforms.</p>

                                <p>Overall I felt confident throughout the process as I built on knowledge from previous projects. However, this being the first time having the proper title of leader was interesting. Thankfully my team was very supportive and rose to the challenge at every step. Being able to work efficiently in the first half of the process certainly proved beneficial when COVID-19 shook things up. Although it was not ideal moving to a fully digital environment, we were able to make the most of the situation and even explore new tools and techniques.</p>

                                <p id="addPadding">Although I am satisfied with our results, certain areas could be more polished and explored. There are areas of interaction that I would have liked to explore more thoroughly, but I am confident that the overall design matches our user goals. Additionally, certain challenges were addressed but could use stronger solutions. We explored tracking content entering and leaving the platform, but a more robust solution beyond notifications could be explored. In the future I will keep the focus of functions more reasonable to ensure enough time for each feature.</p>

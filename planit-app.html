                            <p>For my senior project class I worked alongside 3 other team members, Derek Duty, Ralston Fitler, and Iegor Gutyria on the PlanIt student planner and assistant app. As students ourselves nearing the end of our college careers, we have an understanding of the importance of keeping on top of your class work. We understand the difficulties and attitudes often associated with attending college, especially those starting their college career.

                            <p>The bulk of the process focuses on research to discover information about the user including their goals and behaviors. There are three types of goals:</p>

                                    <p>We conducted research to establish an understanding of the potential domain, competitive technologies, and user goals/behaviors. We wanted to establish research that would allow us to create a solution that matches our user expectations, behaviors, and goals while aligning with business goals and requirements of our concept. This meant researching the domain, current technologies, and ultimately our users’ goals. My main tasks during this stage were exploring competitors and interviewing students.</p>

                                <p>To gain a stronger understanding of competitor technology and user views on them, we completed a competitive audit. This step allowed us to get a better sense of what was currently being offered and how users felt about the solution. To achieve this we examined apps available on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.</p>
                                <p>After downloading five various planner apps, I looked at and noted features were most prominent within the app and what was placed as the home screen. The main focus was on planner apps but I also looked at other automation technologies such as tax filing tools and cross-platform information-based tools such as job applications. I was interested in the idea of making the user's life easier by removing the steps of filling out their schedule.</p>

                                <p>We discovered that although there are a large number of planner apps targeted at students, <span class="boldMe">none of them target students not accustomed to using planners.</span>  In most cases, the apps focus on a monthly overview rather than a more bite-sized weekly or daily view. Although some offer the option of a weekly or daily view, most menu systems are loaded with options creating confusion and extra steps when navigating to the condensed views.</p>
                                <p>This is also the case when creating events on various apps due to the overwhelming number of input fields. The apps lack convenience when inputting information. No automation options are available and each app requires manual input of each detail. Overall, the apps simply seek to replace physical planners rather than improve them.</p>

                                    <p>We first drew out the main interaction before designing the supplemental features. This allowed us to establish the beginning framework and flow that covered many details that would extend into secondary interactions. This included all the information the user would be looking for, primary and secondary navigation, what interactions would occur, any secondary menus, and selection boxes based on inputs.</p>
                                    <p>I then took these whiteboard sketches and further developed them on my iPad.

We utilized a set of usability questions that had the user go through many scenarios to allow the user to fully interact with the prototype while thinking aloud to disclose their thoughts and decisions. <span class="boldMe">We conducted a total of three low-fidelity tests.</span> These early tests were crucial to verifying our user flows and concepts before moving too far into our design direction.</p>
                                <p>Although the test was fairly surface-level, we still received great feedback to consider as we moved forward. Most of the confusion came from interactions and lack of clarity about features.

                                    <p>We addressed these concerns by changing verbiage and simplifying the concept of study sessions to a simple Pomodoro timer. We also refined other interactions and functionality throughout the app to make the process simpler overall.</p>

                    <p>Our primary focus was on allowing students to stay organized and on top of their tasks. We wanted to make the experience and interaction with tracking tasks as simple and streamlined as possible.</p>
                    <p>There are inherent barriers to using physical planners that we sought to overcome. We wanted to create a flexible and quick experience by importing data from their syllabuses to fill their planner. Additionally, we focused on a daily overview to more easily allow the users to digest the information on their home screen. We also wanted to encourage users to mark their daily tasks as complete.</p>

                    <p>We wanted to ensure that our app focused on helping students get through college. We implemented gamification in the form of a tracker under the profile page, however further gamification features would need to be implemented to fully assist and encourage the users.</p>
                    <p>We added secondary features that allow users to study flashcards based on their classes and set a timer utilizing the Pomodoro Technique. We wanted this study time to be flexible and fit around the users' busy lives while also breaking up the time to reduce stress and increase impact. Ultimately, we want our users to be prepared for their classes and pass their exams, assignments, and quizzes so we implemented features targeted at all categories.</p>

                    <h5>Reduce Stress</h5>
                    <p>We explored the concept of reducing stress for our users as initial interviews discovered that our participants had to balance their college, work, and personal lives and often had little time between.</p>
                    <p>We kept a focus on simplicity and ease of use to not add any cognitive load or stress to the users. By implementing automation and bite-size overviews, we wanted to create a product that does not add any more time constraints to the lives of our users. We also wanted to add features that would add value to the user by giving easy access to study tools such as a study timer and flashcards based on their classes.</p>

                    <h5>My takeaways from this project.</h5>
                    <p>This project was extremely insightful and rewarding. This was a great exploration of the Goal-Directed Design process as it allowed me to better cement my understanding of research and design-focused around user goals and behaviors. Being able to conduct research and interviews to establish a plan and keep focus around users allowed for the creation of a product with a focus on the users' goals while maintaining business needs. By implementing testing we were able to adjust, correct, and verify our decisions to ensure a well-developed solution. Being able to connect the dots of each step helps instill confidence in the decisions we made along the way.</p>

                    <p id="addPadding">Although I am pleased with the outcome of this project there definitely were speed bumps along the way. Our goal of automation initially distracted us from user goals when we explored the idea of study sessions to implement the Pomodoro Technique of studying. It took several rounds of testing to implement a simplified solution according to our user responses. This proved the importance of testing and stepping back to view the more simplistic path versus a more technologically advanced feature. I plan on taking more steps back to get a better look at the overview versus focusing too much on specific details.</p>

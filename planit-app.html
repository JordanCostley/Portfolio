                            <p>PlanIt is an iOS mobile application targeted at students who do not use planners or traditional methods to stay on top of their tasks and assignments. PlanIt focuses on three main challenges: helping students achieve their academic goals, encourage and simplify the process of staying organized, and reducing the stress of staying on track. We created PlanIt as a project for a class alongside three other team members utilizing Goal-Directed Design.</p>

                            <h5>The Project</h5>
                            <p>For my senior project class I worked alongside 3 other team members, Derek Duty, Ralston Fitler, and Iegor Gutyria on the PlanIt student planner and assistant app. As students ourselves nearing the end of our college careers we have an understanding of the importance of keeping on top of one's work. We understand the difficulties and attitudes often associated with attending college, especially those starting their college career. We wanted to target the app at benefiting and assisting others in a position that we were once in. The app was designed using the Goal-Directed Design Process. This process allows for a solid foundation in research to get a better understanding of our potential users before establishing concrete solutions to design and test.</p>
                            <p>Goal-Directed Design starts with a research phase to establish an understanding of the potential domain, competitive technologies, and user goals & behaviors. This research allows designers to model a persona as a means of synthesizing their data to assist with creating a solution that matches user expectations, behaviors, and goals. Having a better understanding of what the user looks like means establishing requirements that are more targeted at users while aligning with business goals and requirements. These requirements define what the app aims to accomplish and help the user complete and turns into the design via wireframing of what the actual app will look and behave like before being tested with a variety of usability testing methods. </p>

                            <p>A literature review was completed to gather information on the potential domain. We wanted to gather empirical data revolving around students, planning for tasks and its benefits, and the benefits of gamification as a motivator. This data was used to give insight into the domain of planning and students for when we moved onto the interview stage. Although I was not heavily involved in this area, I still contributed by suggesting topics to research and discussed the findings with my team to have a better understanding of the domain.</p>
                            <p>The findings centered around the concepts of the actual benefits of short-term planning and encouragement by gamification within a school setting. We wanted to be certain that we were heading in the right direction of encouraging those who do not use planners to solidify that there is empirical evidence to demonstrate a benefit. We also wanted to consider more ways to encourage students beyond simply automating their school life. As such, we landed on findings revolving around students benefiting from gamification as a means of encouraging them to do better. This information gave us insight into the tools and tactics used to help better students' lives. The most interesting concept was the idea of adding features to encourage students to succeed in the form of games or competition. This was not something we had considered before as a motivator beyond automation and ease of use.</p>

                                <p>A competitive audit was conducted to examine existing technologies and the user views of them. This area was my main focus and job during this phase of the research along with my team member, Derek. My main focus was on discovering current offerings and user views on said offerings to establish what was possible and what people were interested in. We utilized both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store to examine the current top offerings. We primarily examined planner apps but also looked into technologies that automate the input of information such as tax filing tools. This information helped inform us what options are possible and what aspects users liked and disliked. Although this information proved extremely insightful as to what information to look for in user interviews and what was currently possible with technology, it did not establish what specifically our app would look like as we wanted to be certain that our solution focused on our user goals.</p>
                                <p>We established the features that were most prominent and accessible as the main features within the apps. We also made note of features that were unique to the apps that we deemed as potentially beneficial to our potential users. Regarding the reviews we made note of reviews that included information longer than a simple positive or negative remark. We wanted data that was more insightful than a few words and a star rating. We looked for patterns such as repeating features that were mentioned in positive and negative manners. These features were used as points of reference when conducting our user interviews and areas of focus if the technologies were included in our final design according to our user goals.</p>

                                <p>To properly understand who our users are and what their goals are, we conducted user interviews. We explored information such as what context the application would fit into their lives, their goals and motivations, their mental models, and problems or frustrations within the domain of college and planning for their day to day life. To achieve this knowledge we first created a persona hypothesis to think about what our user might look like in terms of what type of people might use our application, how their needs and behaviors might vary, and what behaviors or environments might need to be explored. The persona hypothesis acts as a means to create discussion and get us on track to move into interviews. It is the first step in allowing us to identify and synthesize the persona which is the step after research.</p>

I took the position as a facilitator for these interviews. It was my role to ensure that any important details that were mentioned by the participant were noted and explored. I would ask them to expand on any topics they mentioned that might help us better understand who they are and what their goals are. I would also have them clarify any points of interest that were not clear from their answers. The ultimate goal was to discover who they were as a person so we could be informed in our decisions later in the design process.</p>

                                    <p>In total we interviewed eight participants which were used to establish our persona. We mapped and synthesized the interview data to create an application according to their goals in the context of their life. We did this by individually synthesizing our thoughts after each interview and coming together to discuss findings by establishing patterns of behaviors. These patterns were used to map the participants into groupings. The group, which included students not using planners, became our primary user and those who were already using planners or other means of being proactive became the secondary persona.</p>

As a means of easily digesting this information, personas are created to take the major components of the various participants where patterns emerged and synthesize the data into one whole model. We established two personas, the first is our primary user who does not use a planner or proactive approach to stay on top of their coursework. The secondary is a more proactive and studious person who already utilizes physical planners and materials to stay on top of their tasks.</p>
                                    <p>These two personas will be referenced throughout the design process to easily tie back our decisions to the data collected. We wanted to make sure that our decisions were solving the problems and goals experienced by our participants that we interviewed. Although our assumptions were close to reality, there were still areas that did not fully match our assumptions and as such these models were used to direct us according to the collected research.</p>

                                <p>Once we understood what our users looked like and determined what their goals and behaviors were, we began to discuss the requirements of the app. We did this by constructing context scenarios in which our users would use our product such as the environment, amount of time available, and potential distractions. This helped us put ourselves into their shoes for the day and consider all the various ways the app might be used. By considering these contexts we discussed and came up with several requirements. These requirements are not specific features or layouts within the product but rather what the app will do at a higher level. We established roughly twenty total requirements for the app.</p>

                                    <h5>The Framework</h5>
                                    <p>Once we established the research on the domain and technologies, understood our users and their goals, and determined the requirements, we were able to begin discussing the wireframe and design. I took the lead and discussed with my team as I whiteboarded wireframe designs. We did this to determine what the main user flow would be as well as secondary flows. We established the key path scenario, the most used interaction, to be the main overview of the day. We wanted this to be the focus as it is what our interview participants spoke most about when they discussed going about their day. After designing the screens for this flow, we asked ourselves what other features would be needed in conjunction with the key path scenario. These other features became validation scenarios and were drawn out from screens already established for the key path scenario. We wanted to think about how a user would use and navigate the application. This includes all the information they would be looking for, information needed to navigate, what interactions would occur, any secondary menus, and selection boxes based on inputs. This conversation was very fruitful in fleshing out the overall layout and flow of the app. Having various points of view created good conversation and consideration as to what the layout and flow might look like according to our user's needs while adhering to design patterns and conventions.</p>
                                    <p>To better understand our initial wireframes and thoughts, I further fleshed out the screens and flows discussed as a team. I wanted to ensure that all the various details of the app were considered and planned to make the digital prototyping as smooth as possible. We discussed my wireframes to ensure they matched our initial designs while accounting for all user flows and features. Below is a selection of the primary screens from this wireframing session.</p>

                                <h5>Low Fidelity</h5>
                                <p>A low fidelity paper prototype was created to do an early round of usability testing. It was decided to create a paper prototype to quickly create a design that could be interacted with while also allowing discussion of flows with the user. We had a moderator, Derek, give the instructions and questions to the user while I was in charge of placing the new screens as the user interacted with the prototype. We utilized a set of usability questions that had the user go through many scenarios to allow the user to fully interact with the prototype. The think-aloud protocol was used to get a better idea as to what the user was thinking as they made their decisions when interacting with the prototype by having them say what they were thinking and doing as they navigated the prototype.</p>
                                <p>This early test was crucial to verifying our user flows and concepts before moving too far into our design direction. We were able to address a number of concerns that were a cause of confusion for the users. The main concern was over certain button placements and user flows revolving around the study session. Initially we had planned on utilizing a swipe feature for interacting with the task items but discovered this was not always an apparent interaction. As such, we considered alternate interactions that a user would expect to be possible. We also discovered that while our navigation icons were discoverable, the study session icon was not immediately discernible. As such we decided although it was usable, we should refine it further to be more easily learned.</p>
                                <p>Ultimately this prototype was used to verify and adjust our established user flows while verifying functions. We discovered certain flows had additional interactions that were either unclear or unnecessary. We also established secondary interactions that the users expected versus our intended interactions. The information my team members recorded during the session was extremely helpful in guiding our directions to focus on our users as we moved into a digital prototype.</p>

                                    <h5>High Fidelity</h5>
                                    <p>Once we established our primary user flow according to our low fidelity test, we moved to Figma to create a medium-fidelity and eventually a high fidelity prototype. We utilized the same style usability tests used for the low fidelity prototype, only with the addition of questions regarding visual aspects and more thorough interaction questions. We used these testing sessions to verify our choices made and tweak areas of confusion or change the flow to better suit our users’ expectations.</p>
                                    <p>The primary area of focus revolved around the study session flows. We wanted to create an automated way of allowing the users to focus on their tasks with intermittent breaks. Other areas of this testing focused on smaller features and interactions to ensure that the product worked and matched our user expectations. We did a total of three rounds of high fidelity testing to ensure all the small details of the application were worked out.</p>
                                    <p>Areas of concern that needed to be addressed revolved around the technical function of buttons, more clear flow of connecting with school, uploading a syllabus, and more clear purpose of the secondary button placed on the navigation bar. The biggest concern, however, revolved around the study sessions. We intended the sessions to initially be an automated system to help users study specific tasks in block sections. The idea was to allow the user to click one button and have a timer built around that day's tasks. However, this interaction proved to be very confusing and not what users expected. Although when explained users liked the idea conceptually, there was room for improvement. Ultimately this was the biggest area that we had to pivot from and move into a more simplified solution that better fits user expectations.</p>
                                    <p>Once we established what we needed to fix and address, we continued to work on the prototype and test along the way. This took several rounds specifically for the study sessions for us to smooth everything out for a final product. During the final stages the COVID-19 pandemic did occur, but thankfully we were able to transition into a virtual environment to finish our prototyping and testing.</p>

                    <p>Our primary focus was on allowing students to stay organized and on top of their tasks. We wanted to make the experience and interaction with tracking tasks as simple and streamlined as possible. There are inherent barriers to using physical planners that we sought to overcome. We wanted to create a flexible experience to automatically display information that students already have access to on their syllabuses by automatically importing this data. We also wanted to allow users to easily track what they have going on for the day and mark tasks completed to ensure they are on top of their work. We focused on a daily overview to more easily allow the users to digest the information.</p>

We sought to implement gamification in the form of a tracker under the profile page, however further gamification features would need to be implemented to fully assist and encourage the users. We added secondary features that allow users to both study flashcards according to their classes and the ability to set a timer utilizing the Pomodoro Technique to better make use of their time. We wanted this study time to be flexible and fit around the users' busy lives while also breaking up the time to reduce stress and increase impact. Ultimately, we want our users to be prepared for their classes and pass their exams, assignments, and quizzes and implemented features targeted at all categories.</p>

                    <p>We explored the concept of reducing stress for our users as initial interviews discovered that our participants had to balance their college, work, and personal lives and often had little time between. A focus on simplicity and ease of use was kept in mind as to not add any cognitive load or stress to the users. By implementing automation and bite-size overviews, we wanted to create a product that does not add any more time constraints to the lives of our users. We also made decisions to make the colors a friendly color while still being customizable if the user chose to change them.</p>

                    <h5>Takeaway</h5>
                    <p>This project was extremely insightful and rewarding. This was a great exploration of the Goal-Directed Design process as it allowed me to better cement my understanding of research and design-focused around user goals and behaviors. Being able to conduct research and interviews to establish a plan and keep focus around users allowed for the creation of a product with a focus on the users' goals while maintaining business needs. By implementing testing we were able to adjust, correct, and verify our decisions to ensure a well-developed solution. Being able to connect the dots of each step helps instill confidence in the decisions we made along the way.</p>

                    <p id="addPadding">Although I am pleased with the outcome of this project there definitely were speed bumps along the way. Our goal of automation initially distracted us from user goals when we explored the idea of study sessions to implement the Pomodoro Technique of studying. It took several rounds of testing to implement a simplified solution according to our user responses. This proved the importance of testing and stepping back to view the more simplistic path versus a more technologically advanced feature. I plan on taking more steps back to get a better look at the overview versus focusing too much on specific details.</p>
